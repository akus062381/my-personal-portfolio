        <div class="description">
            <p>
            Sarah's career has taken some twists and turns over the years, all of which culminated in a decision
            she is very excited about- becoming a software developer. She obtained a bachelors degree in English 
            writing from Marist College in 2003, after which she worked in Account Management until 2007. At that time,
            she decided to return to school and get a masters degree in Education.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Life changes- including marriage, divorce, multiple moves, and the birth of her children- all took place as her career 
            progressed. She began developing a strong track record in sales and revenue generation in industries
            such as logistics, relocation, real estate, automotive, personal care, and recruiting. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The recent economic shift got Sarah thinking about the future in a new way, as it pertains to the financial
            safety and stability of her and her children. As things began to change more quickly than could have
            been anticipated, she realized that the safest career move a person can make in this day and age is one 
            that involves information technology. As she embarks upon this new adventure, she is excited for all 
            that is to come.
